# ORCA Analysis GUI

## Introduction
This repository contains a Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to streamline the analysis of files generated by the [ORCA computational suite](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal). The GUI is launcher by running the [Launcher](/GUI/Launcher.py) in your preferred Python environment. 

## Prerequisites
Upon execution of the [Launcher](/GUI/Launcher.py), the system will prompt you to install any missing packages and automatically add them to your system's PATH if they're not already present. However, we recommend installing all necessary packages and Python modules before using the GUI.

### External Software
- **Python 3.11+**: Download and install from [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **GitHub Desktop**: Download from [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). A GitHub account is not required for installation.
- **Git**: Download from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/). Please install in the default location and add it to PATH if necessary. A GitHub account is not required for installation.

### Python modules
Python modules can be installed via `pip` using your system's command prompt:

```console
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib git lxml PyQt6 pandas openpyxl csv natsort
```

## GUI Functionality
This GUI is currently equipped with 13 modules to streamline the analysis of files generated during several routine and specialized uses of [ORCA](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal), grouped according to their utility

### Input to Output operations

- **1. CREST .xyz Splitter**: Extracts conformers and their energies generated from the [Conformerâ€“Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST)](https://crest-lab.github.io/crest-docs/), an exceptionally efficient tool for mapping low-energy conformations of any analyte. Conformers are extracted to a file format of the users choice. Current support is for conversion to .gjf (Gaussian Input format), although more functionality will be added in the future. 

- **2. Parse .gjf files by cosine sim**: Take a directory containing a series of .gjf files (usually containing multiple conformations of a single analyte), and identifies unique conformations below a user defined threshold based on cosine similiarity and/or energy.

- **3. Gaussian .gjf to ORCA .inp**: Take a directory containing a series of .gjf files and converts each .gjf to the corresponding ORCA .inp file with custom inputs determined via inputs to the GUI interface. This is exceptionally useful for generating ORCA .inp files after parsing .gjf files extracted from CREST for calculation at higher levels of quantum-chemical theory.

- **4. ORCA .out to ORCA .inp (Opt/Freq)**: Take a directory containing a series of ORCA .out files, extracts the final geometry, and writes the extracted geometry to a new ORCA .inp file with custom inputs determined via inputs to the GUI interface. This is exceptionally useful for restarting ORCA calculations on failed runs and run single-point energy evaluations on DFT-optimized geometries using high levels of quantum-chemical theory like DLPNO-CCSD(T) to name a few. 

- **5. ORCA .out to ORCA .inp (VGFC/TD-DFT)**: Take a directory containing a series of ORCA .out files, extracts the final geometry, and writes the extracted geometry to a new ORCA .inp file with custom inputs for computing UV-Vis absorption spectra using the Vertical Gradient Franck-Condon (VG|FC) method, which is sometimes called the Independent Mode Displaced Harmonic Oscillator (IMDHO) model. 

### ORCA .out analyses

- **6. Plot optimization trajectory**: Plots the energy change, SCF energy, max gradient, max step, RMS gradient, and RMS step as a function of the number of optimziation cycles for a single ORCA .out file containing the Opt keyword (or any other vairant that performs a geometry optimization).

- **7. Calculate thermochemistry**: Take a directory containing a series of ORCA .out files and calculates thermochemical corrections and parition functions using the methods of [McQuarrie and Simon (1999)](https://gaussian.com/wp-content/uploads/dl/thermo.pdf) at user specified values of temperature and pressure. Users can also calculate thermochemistry using scaled vibrational frequencies if desired. Morever, users will be notified about the presence of imaginary frequencies and/or imcomplete Opt/Freq jobs. Finally, the code  extracts useful physicochemical properties from the output file, including rotational constants, the rotational symmetry number, X, Y, and Z components of the total dipole moment, and isotropic polarizability. 

- **8. Extract CCSD(T)**: Take a directory containing a series of ORCA .out files and extracts the CCSD(T)

- **9. Extract/plot IR spectra**:

- **10. Extract/plot UV-Vis spectra (VG-FC)**:

### Additional analyses

- **11. Boltzmann-weight CCSs**:

- **12. ORCA LED analysis**:

- **13. ORCA NEB analysis**:
